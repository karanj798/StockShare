# Assignment 2

## Description
The core idea behind this web application is for tracking stock market trades of a given user. The sole purpose for this application is to act as a mock-up application for stock market trading. Due to the recent developments in the stock market, I wanted to create a portal where users can simulate buy and sell transaction, search stock names, and export their transactions into CSV file. This application offers three novel features; search stocks using their ticker name, buy/sell that stock at current market price, and export their transaction into a CSV format. In addition to buy/sell transactions users also get a SMS on their cell phone whenever their transaction is recorded in the Firebase Cloud Firestore, with the help of Twilioâ€™s API.
